{% include JB/setup %}

Hi my name is Derek Harvey and I am a well respected Musician around Northampton. Having also worked in music shops I noticed there was a shortage of guitar tutors especially mobile guitar tutors, so I took it upon myself to right this wrong and offer my services as a mobile recreational guitar tutor.

This means you donâ€™t even need to step out your door, I come to you at your convenience. All lessons are in 30 minute sessions or longer if you require and are catered on a one to one basis. I also have a full enhanced CRB police check that will give you peace of mind which you are more than welcome to view.

There is also a facility to block book lessons if you wish to give as a present for a loved one. Whatever your standard of playing beginner or intermediate, young or older I will endevour to give you the best tuition suited to your requirments.Thank you for visiting my website

“I have always wanted to learn how to play the acoustic guitar, but i never managed to find the time to arrange guitar lessons. That’s the great thing about Derek, he comes to me! It is so convenient for my life style, i have only had a few lessons now but i feel i’m making real progress. Thanks Derek!”

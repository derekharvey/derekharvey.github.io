    <h1>Mobile Guitar Tutor in Northampton</h1>
    <h2>Hi my name is Derek Harvey</h2>
    <p>I am a well respected Musician around Northampton. Having also worked in music shops I noticed there was a shortage of guitar tutors especially mobile guitar tutors, so I took it upon myself to right this wrong and offer my services as a mobile recreational guitar tutor.</p>
    <h3>I'm a mobile guitar tutor</h3>
    <p>This means you donâ€™t even need to step out your door, I come to you at your convenience. All lessons are in 30 minute sessions or longer if you require and are catered on a one to one basis.</p>
    <h3>Safe and Friendly Guitar Lessons</h3>
    <p>I'm Fully CRB Checked, so you can be rest assured that you will be provided with a safe and friendly Guitar Tutor for you or your children to use in Northampton.</p>
